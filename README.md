A small sample of my work from university.

## What These Things Are
* **EAP GUI** - a JavaFX user interface project from my UI class. The full project is there including a JAR that may or may not work nowadays since it uses some older libraries
* **HOCS** - an solution to a problem from my Image Processing/Computer Vision class. See the readme I included in that directory for a better description of what it is. It's neat
* **gaussElimination** - an implementation of a gaussian elimination solution done in MATLAB for one of my math classes
* **s-chat** - a command line chat program that allows people to talk to each other from other devices. See the readme included with it for more info
