#### S-Chat Info

S-Chat was a command line chat program created for my
Operating Systems class. It is a chat program that 
utilizes a proprietary thread setup my professor created
along with sockets and UDP datagrams for the actual
inter-computer communication. 

Please note, the thread program used is no longer 
accessible to me so this piece is more used as
an example of my work in C.
