This was a group project I did in my Graphical User Interfaces class in university.
I'm fairly proud of how it turned out since I did all of the actual drawing implementation
within the application. It's a JavaFX project.

It'll be a pain to get this to run since it's a NetBeans project that requires
external libraries. I've included a .zip of the entire project in this repo
that the instructions below will tell you how to run it in NetBeans. It is provided
as-is with how it was turned in for the class.

I also included the source here along with a JAR of it that may or may not run for you. It runs fine on all my machines but that doesn't guarantee anything.

If you just want to see it in action, here's a YouTube video of it:

EAP GUI Design Editor README

How to run EAP:

1) Unzip "EAP GUI.zip"
2) Start NetBeans
3) Go to the File menu and hit "Open Project"
4) navigate to the directory you unzipped EAP GUI in
5) Open the EAP GUI project
6) A warning will pop up saying a library is missing: to resolve this issue see the Appendix of the Final Report, which contains instructions on how to add in ControlsFX
7) Run EAP. It should be good to go from here
